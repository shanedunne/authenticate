# Authenticate

Created an NFT Marketplace contract with built in escrow for sale of physical items. The idea was for phicical items where a digital version came with purchases and could all be traded on this contract

I coded a couple of frontend componenets here as practice but they are not connected to the contract so this repo should be considered contract only
