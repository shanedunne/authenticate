# Authenticate

With this project I aim to create a platform for brands who produce limited edition or collector item products to have a globally recognised method of authenticating their product. Authenticate will work with brands to incorporate their image and style into digital certificates of authenticity and ownership. Not only now can purchasers show off their item in real life, they can now display their cool, brand designed NFT of ownership in their ETH wallets, Authenticate profiles and possibly in the Metaverse at some later point.

The project and mechanisims required to achieve this are multifacieded

### 1. Claimable NFT
When a purchase of a participating brand or product is made, the purchaser should receive a QR code upon delivery. This QR code will allow users to claim their free Authenticate NFT delcaring ownership and validating that the item is real

### 2. Resale
Authenticate will provide an online resale platform. Re-selling through Authenticate provides a few comforts not provided by general resale sites
- Resales will be sales of the actual NFT, through ETH. Once an item is sold, both the Authenticate NFT + the cost of sale will be moved to an escrow contract. The funds and NFT will not be released until the seller upholds his side of the deal and the item is delivered to the purchaser.
- All deliveries will be required to be executed through tracked and traced postage/courier services. There is the potential to intergrate this within Authenticate in the future
- Relying on tracked and traced, both parties have rights to dispute their agreement. Disputes may be handled on chain through an existing on-chain dispute resolution service or potentially through a future Authenticate DAO
